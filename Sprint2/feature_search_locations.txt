Your Feature Document Must Include Problem Statement
What problem does this solve?
The problem that this feature solves is a solution to location browsing. The user can view locations that are in our database and scroll through them in a UX front-end page. 

User Flow
Step by step from start to finish
Steps:
o create html page
o add css to the page
o replace empty location place-holders with real restraunt information
- names
- address
- brief descripton
- potential images
- links to any other external sites
- locations can be filtered

Technical Plan
Frontend changes: Search page already created in first sprint. Will only replace placeholders with real locations.
Backend routes: Javascript buttons work. Further backend needs to be evaluated and executed.
Database changes: add actual data (locations) to a database so that the data links to the front end.
Files expected to be created or modified
API Changes
New routes
Modified routes
Request and response structure
Database Changes
New tables
Schema updates
New fields
Acceptance Criteria
Clear definition of done

This feature will be done when the front-end page is loaded with pages and pages or "rows" of locations that are viewable.

Must be testable
Example:
User can submit form
Data saves in database
Reload shows persisted data
Error handling works
Feature can be demoed without another feature
If it cannot be demoed independently, it is not scoped correctly.
