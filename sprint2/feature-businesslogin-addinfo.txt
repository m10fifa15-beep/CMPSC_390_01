1. Problem Statement
We want businesses to be able to add their information into the website, but only if they have a business account. We want the page to be interactive for both customers and business owners.  

2. User Flow
I will start by working on the front end, creating the page itself and adding the buttons and make sure that when clicked they work. Then I will create the database with a few "fake" accounts just to make sure that it is workoing. Lastly, I will work on the backend since I will be able to see exactly what I have to make work. I will also make a pseudocode to know exaclt what steps I have to take to approach this because I need to have a plan, and research how to get the backend running on the frontend. 

3. Technical Plan
Frontend changes - There will be 2 options, a login tab and a sign up tab. If the user decides to create an account, they will be asked if they are creating a business account, if the user clicks yes, it will display Business name, email and a password. If the user clicks no, the page will display first name, last name, email and password. Once they click "login" or "create account" they will both be directed to the dashboard. 
Backend routes - Be able to pull in data from the database and update it with new information, con
Database changes - I will have to add a column to the Customers database, where it will display "true" if the user is a business and "false" if the user is not a business (boolean). I will also be working with the restaurants database, since we will be allowing the business to include their information. 
Files expected to be created or modified - file that will be modified is the Customers database and the restaurants database.

6. The user will be able to login or create an account and have access to the dashboard or home page, business will have a button that allows them to add their restaurants information.
