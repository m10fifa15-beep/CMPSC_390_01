1. Trello cards I am in charge of:
	Create Account
	Login Feature

2. I will begin by creating code that the user will see, such as "enter email" and "enter password." I will also set the restrictions for the emails and the password such as the length and what characters are allowed
Then I will continue with the database and checking whether an email already exists or not, and from there either loging in or creating the account

3. This is what done looks like:
	Create Account:
		-if the user doesn’t have an account, they should be able to register and create an account using- their name, email and a password
		-if they are trying to register but the email already exists, the system should let the user know they have to log in
	
	Login Feature:
		- user should insert email and password and login
		- if email is not registered, the system should let the user know they need to create an account

4. I will need to have a database that holds the information of the users, such as their name, email, and passwords- I have to work with Jason on this so when he has this ready next week I can start connecting them
